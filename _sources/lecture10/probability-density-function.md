# The probability density function

Take a continuous random variable $X$.
The *probability density function* (PDF) $f_X(x)$ gives you the probability
per unit of $x$ that $X$ is in a very small region around $x$.
Intuitively, the definition is:

$$
f_X(x) \approx \frac{p(x < X \le x + \Delta x)}{\Delta x},
$$

for $\Delta x$ very very small.
In other words, $f_X(x)$ is the probability that $X$ is between $x$ and
$x + \Delta x$ divided by $\Delta x$.
It is exactly because you divide by $\Delta x$ that this is a
*probability density* and not just a probability.

As you have already realized, I do not like writing $f_X(x)$.
So, if there is no ambiguity, I will write instead:

$$
p(x) \equiv f_X(x).
$$

```{note}
Again, this is not the precise mathematical definition of the PDF of a random
variable, but it is good enough for our purposes.
```

There are some properties that the PDF satisfies which you absolutely need to
remember.
We visualize the most important properties in {numref}`pdf-shape`.

```{figure} pdf.png

:name: pdf-shape

The PDF of a typical continuous random variable looks like this.
It is a non-negative function.
The area between the function and the x-axis is one.
The probability of the random variable being within a given interval is given by
the integral of the PDF over that integral.
In this figure $p(1 < X \le 3) = \int_1^3 p(x)dx$ is the shaded area.
```

(lecture10:pdf-property-1)=
## PDF Property 1: The PDF is non-negative

Because $p(x)$ is a *probability* density and probabilities are non-negative,
we get that:

$$
p(x) \ge 0.
$$

The set of $x$'s for which $p(x)$ is strictly positive is
known as the *support* of the PDF.
Obviously, a random variable cannot take any values outside its support.

(lecture10:pdf-property-2)=
## PDF Property 2: The PDF is the derivative of the CDF

Let $F(x)$ be the CDF of $X$, see
{ref}`lecture10:cumulative-distribution-function`.
Then we have:

$$
p(x) = \frac{dF(x)}{dx}.
$$

This is interesting!
Before proving it, let's check the units.
$F(x)$ has units of probability.
If we divide by $dx$ we get probability density.
This looks promising.
Let's do the proof.

We have:

$$
\begin{split}
p(x) \approx& \frac{p(x < X \le x + \Delta x)}{\Delta x}\;\text{(definition)}\\
&= \frac{F(x + \Delta x) - F(x)}{\Delta x}\;\text{(CDF Property 4)}.
\end{split}
$$
Now the result follows by taking the limit $\Delta x\rightarrow 0$.

As a sanity check, let's look back at {ref}`lecture10:example-manufacturing-steel-balls`.
Does the property hold for what we found there?
Our CDF was:

$$
F(x) = \begin{cases}
0,&\;\text{if}\;x<0.95\;\text{mm},\\
10\;\text{mm}^{-1}\cdot (x-0.95\;\text{mm}),&\;\text{if}\;0.95\;\text{mm}\le x\;1.05\;\text{mm},\\
1,&\;\text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

Taking the derivative with respect to $x$ yields:

$$
p(x) = \begin{cases}
0,&\;\text{if}\;x<0.95\;\text{mm},\\
10\;\text{mm}^{-1},&\;\text{if}\;0.95\;\text{mm}\le x\;1.05\;\text{mm},\\
0,&\;\text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
$$

which agrees with the constant density we found in our example.

(lecture10:pdf-property-3)=
## PDF Property 3: The CDF is the integral of the PDF

We have:

$$
F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x p(\tilde{x})d\tilde{x}.
$$

This follows directly from PDF Property 2 if we employ the [fundamental
theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus).

(lecture10:pdf-property-4)=
## PDF Property 4: Probability the random variable takes values in a set is the integral of the PDF over the set

The probability that $X$ takes values between $a$ and $b$ for $a<b$ is given by:

$$
p(a < X \le b) = \int_a^b p(x) dx.
$$

See {numref}`pdf-shape` for a visualization. The probability is the area between the
PDF, the x-axis, and the endpoints of the interval $[a, b]$.

This is obviously extremely useful because if you have the PDF it allows you
to easily calculate probabilities by doing integrals!
Let's prove it:

$$
\begin{split}
p(a < X \le b) &= F(b) - F(a)\;\text{(CDF Property 4)}\\
&= \int_a^b \frac{dF(x)}{dx} dx\;\text{(fundamental theorem of calculus)}\\
&= \int_a^b p(x)dx\;\text{(PDF Property 2)}.
\end{split}
$$

This property can be generalize.
If $A$ is any set of possible values of $X$, then:

$$
p(X\in A) = \int_A p(x)dx.
$$


(lecture10:pdf-property-5)=
## PDF Property 5: The PDF integrates to one

The property is:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}p(x) dx = 1.
$$

In words, the total area between the PDF curve and the x-axis is one.
Proving this property is obvious.
You just have to notice that:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}p(x) dx = p(-\infty < X \le + \infty) = 1,
$$

because $X$ must take some value.

```{note}
It is a very common mistake to think that the PDF has to be smaller than one.
But the PDF is a *probability density* not a *probability*.
So, it can take values greater than one.
In [](lecture10:example-manufacturing-steel-balls) the probability density
was 10 $\text{mm}^{-1}$.
```

## Questions
You have a random variable $X$ that measures the mass of an object.
What are the units of its PDF $p(x)$?

+ $\text{kg}^{-1}$ (Correct answer)

+ $\text{kg}$

+ The PDF does not have units.
