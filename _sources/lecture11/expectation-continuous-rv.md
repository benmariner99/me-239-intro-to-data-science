# Expectation of a continuous random variable

Let $X$ be a continuous random variable taking real values.
The *expectation* of $X$ is defined by:

$$
\mathbf{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} xp(x),
$$

where $p(x)$ is the PDF of $X$.

## Example: The expectation of a uniform random variable

Take a [uniform random variable](lecture10:the-uniform-distribution):

$$
X \sim U([a, b]).
$$

Its expectation is:

$$
\begin{split}
\mathbf{E}[X] &= \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x p(x) dx\\
&= \int_a^b x \frac{1}{b-a}dx,\;\text{(PDF is zero outside the interval)}\\
&= \frac{1}{b-a}\frac{x^2}{2}|_a^b\\
&= \frac{1}{b-a}\frac{b^2 - a^2}{2}\\
&= \frac{1}{b-a}\frac{(b-a)(b+a)}{2}\\
&= \frac{a+b}{2},
\end{split}
$$

which makes a lot of sense because it is the point between $a$ and $b$.

## Interpretation of the expectation of continuous random variables

Mathematically, the expectation is the x-coordinate of the centroid of the area between the x-axis and the PDF, see {numref}`pdf-p-E-X`.

The expectation of a random variable is the x-coordinate of the centroid of the area between the x-axis and the PDF.
```

As in the discrete case, you can think of the expectation as the value one should "expect" to get.
But, again, take this interpretation with a grain of salt...
See {numref}`pdf-p-E-X-2` for an example where the expectation is a very
improbable value.

The expectation of a random variable does not have to be on a high probability
region.
```

```{note}
In {numref}`pdf-p-E-X-2`, the PDF of the random variable has two distinct peaks.
Each peak of the PDF is called a *mode*.
"Nice" PDF's have a single mode. They are called *unimodal*.
For unimodal PDF's the interpretation that the expectation is the value you
should expect to get makes a lot of sense.
However, a PDF may be multi-modal. Then the expectation is not very useful...
```
